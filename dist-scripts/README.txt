Run the PC-DOI Virtual Box machine in which you have installed Resource Hacker.

To map the folder on the local machine in VBox run from command line:
net use x: \\vboxsvr\Shared
(from http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sf_mount_manual)

Copy the image to the VB Windows machine and then use resource hacker to convert it.
